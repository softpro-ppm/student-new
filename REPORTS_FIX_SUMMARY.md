# Reports.php Fatal Error Fix - Summary

## Issue Resolved
**Error:** `Fatal error: Uncaught PDOException: SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'status' in 'field list' in C:\xampp\htdocs\student-new\public\reports.php:184`

## Root Cause
The error was caused by multiple database schema inconsistencies:

1. **Missing `results` table**: The main database.php config file didn't create the `results` table
2. **Incorrect column reference**: The query was using `status` instead of `result_status` for the results table
3. **Missing `sector_id` column**: The courses table was missing the `sector_id` column referenced in JOIN queries

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Database Schema (`config/database.php`)
- Added `results` table creation with proper structure
- Added `assessments` table creation
- Added `sector_id` column to `courses` table
- Added `sectors` table creation

### 2. Fixed Query Column References (`public/reports.php`)
- **Line 176**: Changed `status = 'pass'` to `result_status = 'pass'` in results subquery
- **Line 219**: Changed `r.status = ?` to `r.result_status = ?` in result status filter
- **Line 275**: Changed `r.status = 'pass'` to `r.result_status = 'pass'` in batch pass rate calculation

### 3. Database Table Structure Fixed
- **results table**: Now has `result_status` column with ENUM('pass', 'fail', 'absent', 'pending')
- **fees table**: Already had correct `status` column with ENUM('pending', 'paid', 'overdue', 'waived')
- **courses table**: Now has `sector_id` column for sector relationships

## Files Modified
1. `config/database.php` - Updated database schema
2. `public/reports.php` - Fixed column references in SQL queries

## Validation
- All database tables now exist with correct structure
- All critical columns are present
- Test queries execute successfully
- Reports page loads without errors

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED
The Fatal PDOException error has been completely resolved. The reports.php page should now function correctly without any database-related errors.
